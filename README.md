Blood donation is a crucial life-saving act that requires efficient management and coordination 
between donors, hospitals, and patients. Traditional blood donation systems often face issues like 
donor unavailability, inefficient communication, and delayed response to urgent requests. To 
overcome these challenges, we propose a Smart Blood Donation and Management System 
integrated with an AI-based chatbot using NLTK and MultinomialNB. The system consists of 
four modules: Admin, Hospital, Donor, and Patient. The admin manages donors, hospitals, and 
feedback, while hospitals approve requests and send alerts. Donors register, receive alerts, and 
check their next eligibility date. Patients can search for blood, send requests, and submit 
feedback. This system ensures seamless communication, enhances donor participation, and 
facilitates timely blood availability.
